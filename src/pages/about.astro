        I’m a web developer with over 10 years of experience in web application
        development. My primary focus is on frontend development, but I also
        have experience in backend development. In addition, I have self-learned
        UI design skills that enable me to create beautiful and user-friendly
        interfaces. I enjoy working with modern technologies such as React,
        React Native and Vue.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a frontend developer, I have worked on projects from small web
        applications to large e-commerce platforms. I enjoy working in teams and
        collaborating with designers and other developers to create efficient
        and effective solutions. My UI design skills allow me to understand the
        needs of the end-users and create user interfaces that are not only
        visually appealing, but also easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my work as a backend developer, I have primarily worked on RESTful
        API development, databases, microservices and third-party service
        integration. I have experience in technologies such as Node.js, Django
        and Laravel. As a personal project, I’m learning about GraphQL
        integration with Node.js and express.

        In my free time and to get out of the routine, I dedicate myself to
        tattoo art and illustration

        This site is my online home and I use it to share knowledge, notes
        and thoughts on web/mobile development and design, as well as where
        I keep track of my work and things I find on the web that help me in
        my day to day professional life.
