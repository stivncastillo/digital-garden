## Description

I wrote a post with a large description about my digital garden, you can read <a href="/blog/how-build-my-digital-garden" class="text-amber-500">here</a>.

this design belongs to the first version of my digital garde, but as you can see it has changed a little ðŸ˜Ž

<ModalImage client:load small="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-1.png" large="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-1.png" alt="Light Screen" />

Here some screens in Dark and Light mode.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
  <ModalImage client:load small="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-3.png" large="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-3.png" alt="Notes Screen" />
  <ModalImage client:load small="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-4.png" large="/assets/images/portfolio/digital-4.png" alt="Playground" />
</div>
