## Description

This app helps manage your Family's everyday life by managing to-dos, tracking grocery and managing rewards.

## Context

This is a side project I'm working on to improve skills like prototyping, design systems, backend, and mobile app design and deployment.
I also want to organize some things in my family, so I build a tool that works for me and that I can keep improving.

## App design
