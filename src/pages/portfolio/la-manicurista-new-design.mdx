## Description

## Problems with old version

</a>

- The design is based on poor implementation of Material by google
- There is not a design system or design files to test the application as a prototype
- Did not have a visual unity
- Bad implementation of satured colors
- Color saturation was poorly implemented

## Context

I was working on the new design in parallel to the design of new features of the application. It was a bit difficult because I had to build the design for both versions.

I started to implement a design system to facilitate the design process in the new version, this improved the process a lot and the design did not take as much time as it did at the beginning.

üôÅ Unfortunately the new application design was never released to the public as the pandemic generated by Covid-19 ended the project.

## Tools

- Sketch App
