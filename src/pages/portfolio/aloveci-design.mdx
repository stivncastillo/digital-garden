## Description

Aloveci is an app to connect neighbors with each other in the Cali city. People could join the community of their neighborhood and thus participate in different groups or dynamics of the app such as:
sell used items, report problems in the neighborhood, offer carpooling, etc.

The owner of the idea already managed several groups of her community via whatsapp, she saw an opportunity to create and monetize the activity she was doing. Among the whatsapp groups she managed in
her community of neighbors she had: 'Sale of used items', 'Exercise group', 'Offer of services', etc.

I participated in the design and ideation of features, unfortunately the application did not have a public version in app stores.
