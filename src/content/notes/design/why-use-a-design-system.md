## Why use a design system?

### Design work can be created and replicated quickly
The main benefit of design systems is their ability to replicate designs by using premade UI components and elements. With this approach the team can use the same elements over and over, They reducing the need to reinvent each component.

### Take pressure off design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems. 
Since simpler UI elements are created already and reusable, design resources can focus less on tweaking visual appearance and more on more-complex problems (like information prioritization, workflow optimization, and journey management).

### It creates visual consistency across products, channels, and (potentially siloed) departments.
When the people work in teams or squads, where each product or squand work independently of the others, the system design provide them a consistent visual appearance and a single source of components, patterns and styles.
