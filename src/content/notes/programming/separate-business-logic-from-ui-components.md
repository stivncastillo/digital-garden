> Separating business logic from UI components brings several advantages to your React applications:

- **Code Reusability:** When business logic is isolated, it becomes easier to reuse components across different parts of the application or even in other projects.
- **Testing:** Testing becomes more straightforward as you can write unit tests for the business logic independently from the UI components. This improves test coverage and overall code quality.
- **Readability and Maintainability:** Decoupling business logic from UI components results in cleaner and more maintainable code. It becomes easier to understand the responsibilities of each part of the application.
- **Scalability:** As your application grows, separating concerns allows developers to work on different parts of the codebase simultaneously without conflicts.

One of the ways to separate de logic from UI is the following:

- Step 1: Identify Business Logic
- Step 2: Create Custom Hooks
- Step 3: Use Custom Hooks in Components
- Step 4: Code Splitting with Suspense

## Some techniques that we can implement

1. Custom Hooks Composition
2. Custom Hooks for Side Effects
3. Context for Global State Management
4. Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for Cross-Cutting Concerns
