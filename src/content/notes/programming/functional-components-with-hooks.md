In modern React development, functional components combined with React Hooks offer a more concise and readable way to manage state and lifecycle behavior. Hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and more enable you to achieve the same functionality as class components, but with simpler syntax and improved code organization.

For example, using the useState hook to manage state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

Functional components with hooks make it easier to understand and maintain your codebase, as they reduce the need for classes, lifecycle methods, and complex state management.
