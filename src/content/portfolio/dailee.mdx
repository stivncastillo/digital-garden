## Description

Driven by a motivation to manage my habits and my daily tasks I am building a system that I can rely on to achieve some medium term goals I have.

I am managing a system of daily points that I can use during the day. Weekly I am doing a retrospective of these points with rewards. I think it can help me with my daily motivation.


## Design system

I started creating the design in Figma and building the design system based on Neo Brutalims.

## Application

Although the project is well underway I still have a long way to go, I am working on a monorepo where I have the client and the server.
I'm using the following stack:

  - React
  - Nestjs
  - Tailwindcss
  - Figma
  - Postgres
  - Graphql
  - ApolloClient
