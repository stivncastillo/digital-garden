## Description

Planning Poker is a web app that allows you to make estimates with your remote teammates with this simple and powerful app. Play in realtime.

## Context

When I worked for LaManicurista (Colombian startup) I designed our own planning poker, we needed a free tool and I wanted to improve my UI design skills, so I decided to make a side project like this one.

I finished the design, but I didn't make the application, because we chose to use Google Sheets ðŸ˜…, a good idea from one of my colleagues.
